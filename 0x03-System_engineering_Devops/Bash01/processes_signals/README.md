## Introduction

Understanding processes and signals is fundamental to Unix-like operating systems' operation and management. This directory provides comprehensive resources and examples to help you grasp the concepts of processes, signals, and process management efficiently.

## Processes Overview

The "Processes Overview" section provides detailed explanations of processes, including their lifecycle, types, attributes, and management techniques. Topics covered may include:

- Process creation and termination
- Process states (e.g., running, waiting, zombie)
- Process identifiers (PID)
- Process scheduling and priorities
- Process control and management commands (e.g., ps, top, kill, pkill)

## Signals Overview

In the "Signals Overview" section, you'll find in-depth discussions on signals, which are mechanisms used for inter-process communication and for notifying processes of asynchronous events. Topics may include:

- Introduction to signals and signal handling
- Common signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL)
- Signal handlers and signal sets
- Sending and receiving signals
- Signal-based process synchronization and coordination
- Scripts and Examples
- Explore the "Scripts and Examples" directory to find practical scripts, code snippets, and examples related to processes and signals. These resources can help you understand how to manage processes, handle signals, and implement various process-related functionalities programmatically. Examples may include:

## Shell scripts for process management tasks

- C programs demonstrating signal handling techniques
- Python scripts for process monitoring and control
- Real-world scenarios and use cases involving processes and signals
