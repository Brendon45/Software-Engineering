# Firewall

## Definition:

- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## Purpose:

- The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to prevent unauthorized access to or from the network.

## Types:

	- Hardware Firewall: A physical device positioned between an internal network and the internet, typically installed at the network perimeter.
	- Software Firewall: A software-based solution that runs on individual devices, such as computers or servers, providing protection at the device level.

## Functionality:

- Packet Filtering: Examines packets of data passing through the firewall and determines whether to allow or block them based on predefined rules.

- Stateful Inspection: Monitors the state of active connections and evaluates incoming packets based on their context within those connections.

- Application Layer Filtering: Analyzes data at the application layer of the OSI model, allowing for more granular control over network traffic.

## Security Policies:

- Firewalls are configured with security policies that define the rules for traffic management, including which types of traffic are allowed or blocked and under what conditions.

## Common Protocols and Ports:

- Firewalls often allow or block traffic based on specific protocols and port numbers, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), used by various services and applications.

## Deployment: Firewalls can be deployed at various points within a network architecture, including:

- Network Perimeter: Protecting the boundary between an organization's internal network and the internet.
