## What Bash scripting should not be used for

- Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks and managing system configurations in Unix-like environments. However, there are some scenarios where it's not the best choice:

1. Performance-Critical Applications: Bash scripting might not be suitable for applications that require high performance or complex computations. Other languages like C/C++ or Python are better options in such cases.

2. Large-Scale Applications: While Bash scripts can handle moderate-sized projects, they can become hard to maintain and scale in larger projects. Using more structured languages like Python or Ruby might be more appropriate for large-scale applications.

3. Cross-Platform Development: Bash scripting is primarily designed for Unix-like systems and may not work seamlessly across different operating systems. For cross-platform compatibility, languages like Python or Java are preferred.

## What is an API

- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

## Real-world example (API):

- The Google Maps API allows developers to integrate maps, geolocation services, and route planning into their applications. Developers can use the API to request map tiles, geocode addresses, and calculate directions.

## What is a REST API

- A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP, and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

## Real-world example (REST API):

- The Twitter API provides access to Twitter's data and functionality, allowing developers to create applications that interact with Twitter's platform. It follows REST principles, where developers can perform actions like retrieving tweets, posting tweets, and searching for users.

## What are microservices

- Microservices are an architectural style where a complex application is composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Real-world example (Microservices):

- Netflix uses a microservices architecture to power its streaming platform. Each microservice handles a specific aspect of the platform, such as user authentication, recommendation algorithms, content delivery, and billing. This allows Netflix to scale different components independently and deploy updates more frequently.

## What is the CSV format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or a database. Each line in a CSV file represents a row of data, and the values within each row are separated by commas or other delimiters.

## Real-world example (CSV format):

 Exporting data from a spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets into a CSV file format. For instance, a sales team might export sales data from a spreadsheet to share with other departments or import into another system for analysis.

## What is the JSON format

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

## Real-world example (JSON format):

When interacting with a weather API, the response might be returned in JSON format, containing information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast. Developers can parse this JSON data to display weather information in their applications.

## Pythonic naming conventions for packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, and constants typically follow these styles:

- Package/Module Names: lowercase_with_underscores
- Class Names: CapWords or CamelCase
- Variable Names: lowercase_with_underscores
- Function Names: lowercase_with_underscores
- Constant Names: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

- CapWords or CamelCase in Python is significant as it helps improve readability and consistency within the codebase. By adhering to a consistent naming convention, it becomes easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.

## Real-world example (Pythonic naming conventions):

Package/Module Names: numpy, pandas
Class Names: HTTPRequest, CustomerService
Variable Names: user_age, total_sales
Function Names: calculate_discount, fetch_data
Constant Names: MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, PI_VALUE
