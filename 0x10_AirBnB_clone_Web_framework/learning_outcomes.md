## What is a Web Framework

- A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. It provides a structured way to build and deploy web applications by offering tools, libraries, and APIs for handling common tasks such as routing, request handling, session management, and database interaction.

## Types of Web frameworks

- As web standards began to advance, the app logic shifted towards the client- ensuring smarter communication between the user and the web application. With logic on client-side, they (client) can react swiftly to user input. This makes web apps more responsive, easily navigate-able on any device. Thus, we have two functions of frameworks — a) the one to work on the server side, that helps to set up app logic on the server (backend) or b) to work on the client-side (front end).

- The front-end frameworks mostly manage the external part of the website, i.e. what the user sees when they open the application. The back-end manages the internal part. Let’s take a deeper look

## 1. Server-side Frameworks

- The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds. To create a web application with a well-developed interface you need a wider range of functionality. Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process. Some of the top server-side frameworks are –

- .NET (C#)

- Django (Python)

- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)

- Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)

- Symfony (PHP)

## 2. Client-side Frameworks

- Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications. Every client-side framework varies in functionality and use. Here are some client-side frameworks for comparison’s sake; all of whom use JavaScript as their programming language-
