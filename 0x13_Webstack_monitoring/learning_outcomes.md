# What is server monitoring?

- Server monitoring involves the process of continuously observing and collecting data related to the performance, health, and availability of servers within a networked environment. 
- This practice is essential for ensuring that servers operate efficiently, identifying potential issues or anomalies, and maintaining overall system reliability. 
- Server monitoring typically involves tracking various metrics and parameters that reflect the status and behavior of servers.

# Importance of Server Monitoring:

1. Early Issue Detection: Monitoring helps detect performance degradation, resource shortages, or hardware failures before they impact users or critical operations.

2. Optimization and Capacity Planning: Server monitoring provides insights into resource utilization patterns, allowing teams to optimize server configurations, plan for scaling, and make informed decisions about infrastructure upgrades.

3. Performance Analysis: Monitoring helps assess the impact of changes or updates on server performance, enabling teams to fine-tune configurations and improve overall efficiency.

4. Security and Compliance: Monitoring facilitates the detection of security breaches, unusual activity, or compliance violations, enabling prompt response and mitigation.

## Some concepts on Monitoring:

- Just as the heart monitor in a hospital that is making sure that a patientâ€™s heart is beating and at the right beat, software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.

- You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our software systems are doing is an important thing.

- Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

## Application monitoring:

- getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected

## Server monitoring:

-  getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

## What are the 2 main areas of monitoring?
- The two primary areas of monitoring are:

## Infrastructure Monitoring:

- This involves tracking the performance and health of hardware, networks, servers, databases, and other IT components. It includes metrics such as CPU usage, memory, disk space, network traffic, and system uptime.
