# Keyset Pagination

Keyset pagination is a method used to paginate results efficiently by using the values of the last retrieved item from the previous page to fetch the next set of items. This method is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and ensures consistent performance and ordering even as new items are added.

### How Keyset Pagination Works

  1. __Initial Request__: Fetch the first set of items with a limit.
  2. __Subsequent Requests__: Use the value of a specific field from the last item of the previous page to fetch the next set of items.

## Example Scenario

Assume you are paginating through a list of items ordered by their creation date in descending order.

### Initial Request

The client requests the most recent 20 items:

    GET /items?limit=20

This returns the 20 most recent items.

### Response Example

    [
        {"id": 1, "created": "2021-01-21T00:00:00"},
        {"id": 2, "created": "2021-01-20T12:00:00"},
        ...
        {"id": 20, "created": "2021-01-20T00:00:00"}
    ]

### Next Page Request

To fetch the next set of items, the client uses the creation date of the last item from the previous response:

    GET /items?limit=20&created_lte=2021-01-20T00:00:00

This fetches the next 20 items where the creation date is less than or equal to`2021-01-20T00:00:00`.

## SQL Query Example

The SQL equivalent for the next page request might look like this:

    SELECT *
    FROM Items
    WHERE created <= '2021-01-20T00:00:00'
    ORDER BY created DESC
    LIMIT 20;

## Benefits of Keyset Pagination

  1. __Consistent Performance__: Performs efficiently even with large datasets, as it avoids the performance pitfalls of large offsets.

  2. __Consistent Ordering__: Maintains consistent ordering even when new items are added, preventing issues like page drift.

  3. __Integration with Existing Filters__: Works well with existing filters without needing significant backend changes.

## Downsides of Keyset Pagination

  1. __Tight Coupling__: Requires the client to use filters and sorting fields for pagination, which can be restrictive.

  2. __Low Cardinality Issues__: Not suitable for fields with low cardinality (e.g., enums) because there might not be enough unique values to paginate effectively.

  3. __Complexity for Custom Sorting__: Complicated for API users when using custom sorting fields, as the client must adjust the filter based on the sorting field.

## Practical Example in Node.js with Express

Hereâ€™s how you might implement keyset pagination in a Node.js application using Express and a SQL database:

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const { Pool } = require('pg'); // Example using PostgreSQL

    const pool = new Pool({
        user: 'yourusername',
        host: 'localhost',
        database: 'yourdatabase',
        password: 'yourpassword',
        port: 5432,
    });

    app.get('/items', async (req, res) => {
        const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit, 10) || 20;
        const createdLte = req.query.created_lte;

        let query = 'SELECT * FROM Items ';
        let queryParams = [];

        if (createdLte) {
            query += 'WHERE created <= $1 ';
            queryParams.push(createdLte);
        }

        query += 'ORDER BY created DESC LIMIT $' + (queryParams.length + 1);
        queryParams.push(limit);

        try {
            const result = await pool.query(query, queryParams);
            res.json(result.rows);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
            res.status(500).send('Server error');
        }
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
    });

## Summary

Keyset pagination is an efficient and consistent method for paginating large datasets. By using the value of the last item from the previous page as a filter, it maintains performance and ordering. This approach is particularly effective for time series or log data but can be complex for API users when dealing with custom sorting fields.
