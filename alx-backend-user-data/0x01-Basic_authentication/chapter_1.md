# Understanding Authentication

__Introduction__

Authentication is a security process used to verify the identity of users or systems. This step ensures that only authorized individuals or entities can access protected resources or perform specific actions.

Key Concepts

Identity Verification: Authentication confirms that someone or something is who or what they claim to be.
Methods: Common methods include passwords, biometrics, security tokens, and digital certificates.
Example: Logging into a website with a username and password is a form of authentication. The system checks if the provided credentials match those stored in its database.
