# Understanding Authentication

__Introduction__

Authentication is a security process used to verify the identity of users or systems. This step ensures that only authorized individuals or entities can access protected resources or perform specific actions.

__Key Concepts__

- __Identity Verification__: Authentication confirms that someone or something is who or what they claim to be.
  
- __Methods__: Common methods include passwords, biometrics, security tokens, and digital certificates.

- __Example__: Logging into a website with a username and password is a form of authentication. The system checks if the provided credentials match those stored in its database.

__Python Example__

Using Python's `requests` library, you can perform Basic Authentication to access a secured API:

    import requests
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

    # Define your credentials
    username = 'user'
    password = 'pass'

    # URL of the resource you want to access
    url = 'http://example.com/api/resource'

    # Send a GET request with Basic Authentication
    response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))

    # Print the response status and content
    print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response Text: {response.text}")

__Explanation__:

1. `import requests`: Imports the `requests` library for making HTTP requests.

2. `from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth`: Imports `HTTPBasicAuth` for handling Basic Authentication.

3. `username` = `'user'` and `password` = `'pass'`: Define your authentication credentials.

4. `url` = `'http://example.com/api/resource'`: Specifies the URL of the resource.

5. `requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))`: Sends a GET request to the URL with Basic Authentication.

6. `response.status_code`: Retrieves the HTTP status code of the response.

7. `response.text`: Retrieves the body of the response.
