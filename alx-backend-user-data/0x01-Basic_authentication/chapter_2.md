#  Understanding Base64 Encoding

__Introduction__

`Base64 encoding` is a method for converting `binary` data into a `text` format. This encoding ensures that binary data can be transmitted over text-based systems without corruption.

__Key Concepts__

__Binary to Text Conversion__: Base64 encodes binary data into a string of ASCII characters.

__Common Use Cases__: Base64 is used in email, embedding images in HTML/CSS, and encoding data in web APIs.

__Real-World Example:__

When you embed an image directly in an HTML document using Base64 encoding, you encode the image file into a Base64 string and include that string in the HTML `<img>` tag. This method allows you to avoid separate image files and embed the image data directly in your HTML code.

__How It Works__

__Base64 Encoding__: The image file is converted into a Base64-encoded string. Base64 is a method of encoding binary data (like image files) into ASCII text. This text format can be easily embedded in HTML.

__Embedding in HTML__: The Base64 string is included in the src attribute of the <img> tag, prefixed with a data URL scheme that specifies the image type and encoding.

__Example Breakdown__
Here's a detailed explanation of the HTML code:

html code 

    <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...">
    
1. __<img> Tag__: This is an HTML element used to embed images in a web page.

2. __src Attribute__: This attribute specifies the source of the image. Instead of a URL pointing to an external file, it contains a data URL.

3. __data:image/png;base64,__: This is a data URL scheme. It specifies that the data is an image (image/png) and that the data is Base64-encoded.

4. __iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAU...__: This is the Base64-encoded image data. It's a long string of characters that represents the binary data of the image.
