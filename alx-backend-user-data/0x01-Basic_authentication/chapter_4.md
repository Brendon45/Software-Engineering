 # Using Basic Authentication and Sending the Authorization Header

 Basic Authentication is a straightforward method used to authenticate users in HTTP requests. It involves sending a username and password in the HTTP request's Authorization header to gain access to a protected resource.

How Basic Authentication Works
Request with Authentication Header: The client (such as a web browser or an API client) sends a request to a server that requires authentication. The request includes an Authorization header with the credentials.

Credentials Encoding: The username and password are encoded in a specific format before being sent. In Basic Authentication, credentials are encoded using Base64 encoding.

Server Response: The server receives the request, decodes the credentials, and verifies them. If the credentials are valid, the server processes the request and responds with the requested resource. If invalid, the server returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
